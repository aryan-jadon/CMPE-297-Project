### Project Abstract
On the Internet, a massive volume of video recordings
is made and shared daily. It has become very challenging
in todayâ€™s daily life to watch videos that may last longer than
anticipated. Sometimes our efforts may be in vain if we cannot
discern helpful information from them. Automatically creating
summaries of these videos material enables us to rapidly scan
for critical themes and saves us time and effort from having to
watch the entire thing again. Our system aims to provide the
user to upload a video and get the transcription of the video,
which converts speech to text and classifies the video as per the
categories. It is helpful to determine the tags of the videos that are
being uploaded. The work of classifying videos has become very
successful recently. Remarkably, the subject has drawn increased
interest since deep learning models became an effective tool for
identifying videos.
